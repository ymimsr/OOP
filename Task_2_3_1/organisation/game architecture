model routine:
    1) for each snake:
        look at tile
            (should i add onCollision method for obstacle, food, etc?)
            1) if it's an obstacle - lose
            2) if it's a food - grow and move
            3) if it's a free tile - move
    2) check win condition
    3) wait some time (depends on chosen difficulty)

snake:
    1) has a list of snakeParts
    2) has a direction of a snake
    3) can move
    4) can move and grow

snakePart:
    1) has position

obstacle:
    1) has position
    2) onCollision method ends the game

food:
    1) has position
    2) onCollision method increases snake's grow moves

freeTile:
    1) has position
    2) onCollision method does nothing

controller routine:
    1) listen for events
    2) update user's snake direction
